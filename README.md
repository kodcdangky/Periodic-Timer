Periodic Timer v1.0.0

A timer which plays a chosen sound at the end and loops automatically and continuously

I made this to learn more about programming with GUIs and because I needed a timer like this for my own usage.

Feel free to download, modify, and use as you wish, as long as it's for non-commercial purposes

Made with:
- PySimpleGUI v4.56.0 @ https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI
- Gensound v0.5.2 @ https://github.com/Quefumas/gensound
