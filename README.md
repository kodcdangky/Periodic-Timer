# Periodic_Timer
A timer which plays a chosen sound at the end and loops automatically and continuously

I made this to learn more about programming with GUIs and because I needed a timer like this to help me remember to drink water (lmao).

Feel free to download, modify, and use as you wish, as long as it's for non-commercial purposes
